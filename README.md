Accident Detection VANET
 The  project  builds  an  accident  detection  system based on the concept of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network(VANET). VANET follows a basic concept which consists of a large web of vehicles and a wireless local area network(WLAN) technology  that  connects  all  the  vehicles  together  to  make communication possible. The network is built on the highway  with  the  use  of  RF  transmitters  and  receivers. The main  aim  of  VANETs  is  to  build  an  Intelligent  Transport System  (ITS).  Multiple  IoT  sensors  are  embedded  in  each vehicle to detect the accident. This information is immediately broadcasted over the VANET, during which the vehicle  nodes  of  the  network  act  as  relays  to  transmit  the information  over.  Ultimately,  the  information  reaches  the central hub with the exact geographical location of the accident,  where  the  information  is  processed  and  classified using  machine learning techniques. Based on the severity of the accident, messages are sent to the nearest hospital, police station and other concerned authorities.
